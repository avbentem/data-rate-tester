## LMIC pin mapping

For [LMIC use](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic#manual-configuration):

```cpp
// Pin mapping
const lmic_pinmap lmic_pins = {
    .nss = SS, // active-low SPI slave-select; pin 18
    .rxtx = LMIC_UNUSED_PIN, // rx/tx control
    .rst = RST_LoRa, // reset; pin 14
    .dio = {DIO0, DIO1, DIO2} // digital input/output; pins 26, 33, 32
};
```
